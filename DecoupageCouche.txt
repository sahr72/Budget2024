Layer Responsibilities in Your Architecture
Core

Contains the domain entities, interfaces, and business rules.
Should be independent of external libraries like EF Core.
Application

Contains the application-specific logic, DTOs, and service interfaces.
Mediates between the presentation layer and infrastructure.
No direct dependency on EF Core but can interact with repository interfaces defined in Core.
Infrastructure

Implements the repository pattern, database interactions, and EF Core configurations.
EF Core 8 should be installed and used here.
Contains the DbContext, migrations, and repository implementations.
Blazor

The presentation layer for the user interface (Blazor Server app).
Should interact only with the Application layer (service interfaces) for CRUD operations.
Tests

Contains unit and integration tests.
May reference the Infrastructure layer for integration testing with an in-memory database like SQLite or an EF Core in-memory provider.
